            What is Console Screen?
            </b>
            <br>
            Console Screen helps us in finding the errors, in the code we write, very easily. It also tells in which line is the error situated. You can also see the output sometimes, but only if write the command 'console.log'!
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>
            How does it help us?
            </b>
            <br>
            As I also told earlier, console helps us to find the errors. And if you want to add a code directly in the console screen; then you don't have change the tabs {from visual studio to website (console)}.

            </b>
